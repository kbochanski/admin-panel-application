# Admin Panel

Example application using frameworks that get you to your business relevant needs as quick as possible. Automatic user interface generation with [Refine](https://refine.dev/docs/getting-started/quickstart/) and unique resource centric architecture by [FeathersJS](https://feathersjs.com/guides/basics/generator.html) that allows developers to immediately start coding business logic.

# Develop

Backend:
Using Feathers CLI ðŸŽ‰ to handle service creation.

Frontend:
Using `dataProvider={dataProvider("http://localhost:3030/")}` to connect to Feathers backend (served on port `3030`). Refine automatically creates forms from data it receives using an [Inferencer](https://refine.dev/docs/packages/documentation/inferencer/). You can always customize Refine [data providers](https://refine.dev/docs/tutorial/understanding-dataprovider/index/) and/or [components](https://refine.dev/docs/tutorial/adding-crud-pages/mui/index/).


```bash
# Start frontend and backend -- local directories are mounted as volumes
docker compose up

# Database operations -- Create database
npm run migrate
# Create file for migration
npm run migrate:make -- <migration-name>
# Edit file then run
npm run migrate

# Test - backend with Mocha
cd backend: npm test
```
